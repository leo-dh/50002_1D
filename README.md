# FGPA 1 bit Full Adder Test using Mojo v3

These files are for the FGPA used in the mini hardware project for 50.002 1D. 
The main aim of the project is to test the outputs of the 1 bit full adder through the FGPA via manual switches or through the implementation of a state machine.
The default state is the IDLE state where all inputs (a,b,c_in) are 0. There are a total of 8 states to test. Each state will be passed only if it receives the correct output from the sum and carry out of the adder.
